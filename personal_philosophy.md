# Personal Philosophy & Character Study

## 1. Dharma as a Guiding Light
**"Dharma isn't always glamorous—it's sometimes just the willingness to keep going when the path makes no sense."**

Life is like a rock eroding in a river. We construct meaning to bring order to chaos. My dharma has been shaped by doing what I didn't want to do—working free gigs, PA jobs, projects I didn't connect with. These weren't mistakes; they were the path.

## 2. The Burden of Purpose
We define ourselves rigidly, but we are just becoming. My purpose isn't static. It's the sum of my experiences.
*   **Home:** Not a place, but wherever I am living my purpose.
*   **Friends:** Like Horcruxes—pieces of myself that I trust with others.
